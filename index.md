#Assignment 7 write up
#introduction
In this module, we looked at advanced methods of getting different results from tables. 
Instead of getting direct 1:1 translation from one table, we looked at things like calculations, getting results only if certain conditions are met, etc.

##Explain when you would use a SQL UDF.
One would use a SQL user defined function when someone would need to have a complex calculation or accepted parameters done throughout multiple tables or databases.

##Explain are the differences between Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions.
An inline function is a function where the function body is just one line of a select statement.
On the other hand, a multi statement function is a table valued function with many statements in the table variant.

##conclusion
There are many ways to retrieve values or conditions from specific tables. 
The way one retrieves this information all depends on the personâ€™s understanding of different methods like a function.
